# Enemies Behavioral Strategies
1. The game has completed basic strategies like in the specification and video.
2. Higher score: this game has a difficulty adjustment function:
    EASY: enemies attack whenever not in cooldown. Move slowly.
    NORMAL: melee enemies only attack when the attack can hit the player. Ranged the same as easy. Move moderately fast.
    HARD: melee enemies only attack when the attack can hit the player. Ranged the same as normal. Move as fast as the player.

# AI Tools:
NO, I have not used any AI tool at all.

# Other high mark implementations:
1. Background music
2. Player melee & ranged attack audio (I do not add sound for enemies because that would be too noisy)
3. Options menu where
    i. Adjust master volume
    ii. Adjust music volume
    iii. Adjust effects volume
    iv. Adjust difficulty
4. Game elements and user interface are clear and easy to distinguish.
5. The user interface is designed in a uniform style, 
and each menu has a slightly different BLUE background color to let the user distinguish them more easily.
